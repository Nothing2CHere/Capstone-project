Capstone Project for Springboard Class - Data Science Intensive

3 Ideas for a project  (data set / question I'm trying to answer or problem I'm trying to solve)

     1   Project Title - Reducing the cycle of poverty
         Primary Dataset title - Expenditures on Children by Families
         Objective - Compute what a household minimum living wage is for a 1 or 2 parent household for 2 different scenarios.
              Scenario 1 - family just has enough to survive on day to day.  Perpetual poverty generation to generation.
              Scenario 2 - family has enough to enable their children a chance at upward mobility.
         Datasets - (1) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/expenditures-on-children-by-families
                    (2) Pull cost of secondary education and trade schools by location.
                    (3) Pull cost of living numbers by location.
                    (4) Quantify costs involved with raising children so they have a chance at upward mobility.
                           - could be a subset of the primary data set where families are already in middle to upper class.
         Client - Supporting research for legislation proposal on minimum wage and related government social/welfare programs.
         Client Benefits - (1) Reduce short term and long term povery rates by setting a real living wage as minimum wage.
                           (2) Quantify public cost investment per child required to give a child a chance at upward mobility.
         Tasks - (1) Find data sets for education costs and cost of living costs.

         Comment:  Public policy proposals get very messy and the whole picture requires research well beyond the scope of being a data            scientist
         
         
     2   dataset = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard
         question or problem - rank colleges based on best investment in your future
     
     
     
     3   dataset = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/zip-code-data
         question or problem - which states or areas of the country get the most out of tax deductions per capita
