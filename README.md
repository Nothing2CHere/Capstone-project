Capstone Project for Springboard Class - Data Science Intensive

3 Ideas for a project  (data set / question I'm trying to answer or problem I'm trying to solve)

     1   Project Title - Reducing the cycle of poverty
         Objective - Compute what a household minimum living wage is for a 1 or 2 parent household for 2 different scenarios.
              Scenario 1 - family just has enough to survive on day to day.  Perpetual poverty generation to generation.
              Scenario 2 - family has enough to enable their children a chance at upward mobility.
         Client - Supporting research for legislation proposal on minimum wage and related government social/welfare programs.
         Client Benefits - (1) Reduce short term and long term povery rates by setting a real living wage as minimum wage.
                           (2) Quantify public cost investment per child required to give a child a chance at upward mobility.
                  Datasets - (1) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/expenditures-on-children-by-families
                    (2) Pull cost of secondary education and trade schools by location.
                    (3) Pull cost of living numbers by location.
                    (4) Quantify costs involved with raising children so they have a chance at upward mobility.
                           - could be a subset of the primary data set where families are already in middle to upper class.
         Tasks - (1) Find data sets for education costs and cost of living costs.
                 ..
                 ..
         Comment:  Public policy proposals get very messy and the whole picture requires research well beyond the scope of being a data            scientist
         
         
     2   Project Title - Removing Tax Deduction Bias & Abuse
         Objective - Make suggestions on how to remove federal tax deduction bias out from the tax code.  Personal taxes only.
         Client - Government tax policy.
         Client Benefits - Make tax policy fair and harder to abuse in terms of deduction rates.
         Dataset = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/zip-code-data
         Tasks  (1) Explore data distributions by income level and by location in terms of gross income, total deductions, tax rate as a                     percentage of gross and adjusted incomes.
                (2) Quantify and visually show unfairness by income level and by location.
                (3) Quantify abuse and outliers and visuallly show.
                (4) Propose new rules or guidelines and show what happens to unfairness and outliers.  Proposal should be total tax                         neutral.
                (5) Capture what happens to total tax revenue collected and tax scale progressiveness.
